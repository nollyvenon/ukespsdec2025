## GitHub Actions Deployment Guide

### Overview
The Ukesps application includes automated deployment using GitHub Actions. This enables automatic updates to your web server when code is pushed to the repository.

### Setup Requirements
1. **GitHub Repository**: The code must be hosted in a GitHub repository
2. **Server Access**: You need FTP access to your web server
3. **Secrets Configuration**: Set up deployment secrets in repository settings

### Configuring GitHub Secrets
Navigate to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions and add the following secrets:

**Required for FTP Deployment:**
- `FTP_SERVER` - Your FTP server hostname (e.g., ftp.yourdomain.com)
- `FTP_USERNAME` - Your FTP login username
- `FTP_PASSWORD` - Your FTP login password

**Optional for Advanced Configuration:**
- `FTP_PORT` - FTP port (default: 21)
- `FTP_SERVER_DIR` - Target directory on server (default: root directory)
- `FTP_PROTOCOL` - Protocol to use: `ftp` or `ftps` (default: `ftp`)

**Optional for Post-Deployment SSH Tasks:**
- `SSH_HOST` - Your server hostname for SSH access
- `SSH_USERNAME` - SSH username
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH private key for authentication
- `SSH_PORT` - SSH port (default: 22)
- `REMOTE_PROJECT_PATH` - Path to your project on the remote server

### Deployment Process
When code is pushed to the main branch:
1. Code is retrieved from the repository
2. PHP and Node.js dependencies are installed
3. Frontend assets are built and compiled
4. Files are transferred to the server via FTP
5. Post-deployment tasks are executed via SSH (if configured):
   - Configuration caching
   - Database migrations
   - Storage linking
   - File permission adjustments

### Post-Deployment Tasks
The following Laravel commands are automatically executed:
- `php artisan config:cache` - Cache application configuration
- `php artisan route:cache` - Cache application routes
- `php artisan view:cache` - Cache compiled views
- `php artisan migrate --force` - Run pending database migrations
- `php artisan storage:link` - Create symbolic link for storage directory

### Customizing Deployment
To modify the deployment process:
1. Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repository
2. Adjust triggers (branches, tags)
3. Modify build steps as needed
4. Change file exclusions if necessary
5. Customize post-deployment commands

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
- **Connection Issues**: Verify FTP server details and credentials
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure FTP user has proper write permissions
- **Deployment Failures**: Check GitHub Action logs for detailed error messages
- **SSH Connection**: Validate SSH host details and private key format

#### Testing Deployment:
- Use a staging branch first
- Set up dry run mode if available
- Monitor the GitHub Actions log for successful deployment

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit credentials to the repository
- Use strong passwords for FTP accounts
- Consider using FTPS for encrypted file transfers
- Regularly rotate deployment credentials
